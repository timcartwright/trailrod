    about_part_one_html: "<h2>Our Story</h2><p>With more than 6 million participants in Europe and the United States, the growing success of the trail has not spared the island of Rodrigues. The idea first came from Philippe La Hausse de la Louvière and Yan de Maroussem of Rando Trail Nature, Mauritius in 2008. Eric Lacroix from the University of Reunion later became the main consultant of the race.</p><p>The first edition took place on 21st November 2010 with just over 300 participants. In 2011, the Rod Trail Association is born and took charge of the entire organization of the Trail of Rodrigues.</p><p>The Association works closely with institutions, national and international associations, and NGOs. From 300, the number of participants has increased to more than 900, combining professional athletes, the great personalities of Trail, and sports fans in a spirit of democracy, discipline and togetherness.</p>"
    about_part_two_html: "<h2>Authentic Experience</h2><p>The Trail of Rodrigues brings together men, women and children around a healthy practice that combines sport, discovery, proximity with nature and respect for the environment.</p><p>The 4 trails offer a variety of technical difficulties: the mountain landscape with its grassy slopes, the earthy paths and rocky patches, and the coastline with its rocky outcrops, sandy beaches and coves. Without much risk, we run with a backdrop of beautiful scenery.</p><p>The Trail is a beneficial stop almost out of time, a still picture mingling tranquility and beauty. It allows a vacuum to face oneself and to purge negative emotions.</p><p>Meet for a truly authentic experience on Sunday, November 3, 2019 for the 10th edition of the Trail of Rodrigues.</p>"

As soon as we arrive we are lulled by the cries of some rare birds including a beautiful white bird known as 'Bird of the Virgin' by the Rodrigais, and brown noddy or macoua, a kind of black seagull. These birds are everywhere and come close. One can enjoy a long swim and bask on the warm white sand.</p>"
